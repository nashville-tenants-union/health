# Waste

* Intentional waste of resources in order to argue that surplus populations are a societal burden
  * Eugenic burden
  * Debt burden

---

# Labor

* Surplus populations are separated from labor based on relation to capital

---

# Madness

* The asylum system separates surplus from the working class
* Preyed upon by capital for extraction

---

# Pharmacology

* The pharmaceutical industry has been used to create imperialist trade policies
* Resistance through organizing
    * ACT UP
    * Treatment Action Group (TAG)

---

# Border

* Imperial core develops private health industries
    * Periphery is forced to privatize their national healthcare solutions

---

# Care

* SPK (Sozialistisches Patientenkollektiv) was formed to offer an alternative to the capitalist West German state.
    * radical patients' group in the 1970s

---

# Cure

* SPK was demonized by those in power to prevent their influence and erase their history

---

# Host

* Cannot be rigidly defined 
    * policies change over time

* Threat to capital
    * Removing this division builds solidarity
        * Increases union power
    * Reduce profits (a.k.a. stolen wages)
        * The profits are artificially high due to the creation of a surplus population

# Treatment of Surplus

"Organized Abandonment"

* deliberate manipulation and dispossession of resources from Black, Brown, Indigenous, disabled, and poor communities
* more vulnerable to adverse health
* social value is considered "as good as dead"
    * popularly considered "waste"

<!-- Ruth Wilson Gilmore coined this phrase. -->

"Extraction"

> Surplus populations are spun into gold. Disability is commodified through [a] matrix of incarceration (prisons, hospitals, nursing homes).

~ Jasbir Puar

# What is Waste?

Popular eugenic narratives depict the surplus population as "wasting resources".

The popularized myth of "waste".

Waste is actually in the bureaucratic system that judges who is surplus and unnecessarily expands carceral care.
