# Treatment of Surplus

"Organized Abandonment"

* deliberate manipulation and dispossession of resources from Black, Brown, Indigenous, disabled, and poor communities
* more vulnerable to adverse health
* social value is considered "as good as dead"
    * popularly considered "waste"

<!-- Ruth Wilson Gilmore coined this phrase. -->
